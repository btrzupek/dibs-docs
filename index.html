          <h1 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h1>

<p>To use Dibs, head on over to the <a href="https://www.grabdibs.com/register">registration page</a> and create an account if you have not already. Additionally, you can also <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dibs-buy-sell-unique-vintage-second-hand/id779556743">download the Dibs mobile app</a> from the App Store for the premier Dibs experience.</p>

<p>Once you have an account on Dibs you will be able to follow along with everything described here.</p>

<h1 id="selling-on-dibs">Selling On Dibs</h1>

<p>Everyone can sell antique, vintage, unique, and artisinal items on dibs. Dibs provides varying tools for the multiple types of sellers we commonly work with. These seller types include:
- <strong>General Seller</strong> - local artisans or people with some goods to sell.
- <strong>Storefront Sellers</strong> - folks who have anything from a small artisanal or craft business, all the way to folks with a retail shop.
- <strong>Wholesale Sellers</strong> - sellers who desire some privacy around content and pricing, and maintain a group of active buyers.</p>

<p>This document is separated into sections to address the needs and functions available to each of these types of Dibs users.</p>

<h2 id="posting-your-first-item">Posting Your First Item</h2>

<p>Selling on Dibs could not be easier! You simply take a picture, add pricing and description information, and post it. </p>

<p><img src="images/SusanHorneImage.jpg" alt="test.png" /></p>

<h3 id="step-1-take-a-picture">Step 1. Take A Picture</h3>

<p>The first step is to either snap a few new pictures of the item you want to sell, or choose some great pics from your camera roll. You can add up to five pictures per post. </p>

<aside class="notice">
You should have only a single item per post, don&rsquo;t try and put five pictures of different items into a single post, because you get a single description and price for the post. 
</aside>

<h4 id="quality-pictures">Quality Pictures</h4>

<p>Choose clear, well lit images that highlight the best features of your items. The picture is what is going to sell your item, so make it great! As your item price increases, multiple pictures are a virtual requirement to provide the buyer with enough information to engage in the sale.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-add-a-price-and-description">Step 2. Add a Price and Description</h3>

<p>The next step is to add the details about your item to the post.  On this screen you will be able to add the following information to your post:
- Price
- Category
- Description</p>

<p>After adding these details to your post, you can proceed to the next step.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-post-destinations">Step 3. Post Destinations</h3>

<p>The final step for posting an item allows you to set the location for the item being posted and share your item into your Facebook feed or to a Facebook group that you are a member of.  If tap on either of these buttons, you will be required to login with Facebook (if you are not already). </p>

<h4 id="location">Location</h4>

<p>By default, the post will be created at your current location. This is great if are at the same place where the item is being sold, however in some situations you may want to post from a different location. For example, you tap the button that says &ldquo;Current Location&rdquo; and then move where the item will be placed at. This is a great option if, for example, you are posting inventory for sale at a retail store, but you are sitting at home while posting the item.</p>

<h4 id="facebook">Facebook</h4>

<p>Sharing to your own feed is a great way to let your Facebook friends know about your item.</p>

<p>Sharing to a Facebook Group is a great way for you to target other like minded folks, and gain a broader audience for your item. </p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to share your feed on Facebook then you can just proceed to the next step, which will save your post.</p>

<h3 id="viewing-your-finished-post">Viewing Your Finished Post</h3>

<p>When the post is complete you will receive a message telling you of the success. Dismiss this screen.
<aside class="notice">
Note, if you wish you can also invite Facebook friends from this screen. This will share the link for the item you just posted ot to the people you invite so they can see what you are selling.
</aside></p>

<p>When you return to the main app screen, use the tab bar at the bottom of the application to go to your user profile. Tap the far right person shaped tab to do this. Once you are there you will see your profile, and near the middle of the screen you will see a tab section that includes these labels; Social, Buying, Selling, &amp; Favorites. Tap on the Selling tab and you will see your item in the grid below. Tapping on that item in the grid will take you to the item detail view where you have additional options related to your post.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-your-post-with-a-bigger-audience">Sharing Your Post With A Bigger Audience</h3>

<p>You have several options for how to share a post with others and grow the audience for the item. Posts can (or will be, depending on the type) be shared in the following manners:
- Shared with your followers
- Shared via friend invitations
- Shared through Facebook
- Shared with the IOS Share Sheet</p>

<h4 id="sharing-with-followers">Sharing with followers</h4>

<p>Whenever you post an item, it is shared with your followers. This means that when your follower opens the app, they will see your item in their various feeds (as applicable by location or filter). </p>

<p>People can find you and follow you in app by navigating to your items or your profile and tapping the follow button. You should encourage your friends to follow your account, as it helps grow your audience for your posted items. </p>

<h4 id="sharing-via-friend-invitations">Sharing via friend Invitations</h4>

<p>You can also send email invitations to people in your address book and grow your follower base that way. There are two simple ways to send email invitations via Dibs. </p>

<p>You can navigate to the Social Feed tab, in the bottom tab bar, and once you are on the Social Feed you will see a person shaped icon on the left side of the Navigation Bar. Tap that icon and it will bring you to the email invitation screen. </p>

<aside class="warning">
Please accept the IOS permissions that lets Dibs read your address book. Without doing this, you will not be able to send email invitations from within the app.
</aside>

<p>The email invitation screen allows you to choose emails from your address book, manually enter email addresses, and send a test email to yourself so you can see what the email looks like before inviting your friends.</p>

<p>You can also use the Tab Bar at the bottom of the application and go to your User Profile. Once you are at your User Profile, tap the &lsquo;Options&rsquo; button in the top right of the Navigation Bar. This will bring you to the User Profile Options screen, where you can access the following invitation systems depending on your current User Role on Dibs:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
<th>Invitation Type</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Required Role</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
<td>Friend Invitation</td>
<td>Allows you to invite friends via email. These friends will receive an email to download the app and find you on Dibs.</td>
<td>Any Registered User</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Storefront Customer Invitation</td>
<td>Allows Storefront sellers to invite customers to follow their store. The email will contain a direct link to the store so the customers can easily find it and follow you.</td>
<td>Registered Storefront Users</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wholesale Customer Invitation</td>
<td>Allows Wholesale Sellers to invite customers to their private sales channel. This will require the wholesale seller to approve all users access once they accept your invite. In this way you have total control over who has access to your wholesale pricing and products.</td>
<td>Registered Wholesale Selling Users</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4 id="sharing-through-facebook">Sharing through Facebook</h4>

<p>Once you post an item, an item posting success screen appears with a &ldquo;Invite Friends To Dibs&rdquo; button. Tapping this button will bring up the Facebook Invitation Share Sheet, and the invite from you will include a link from Facebook to download and install Dibs. This will help you get your friends on Dibs.</p>

<h4 id="sharing-with-the-ios-share-sheet">Sharing with the iOS Share Sheet</h4>

<p>Probably one of the most robust sharing solutions in the app, is the IOS Share Sheet. To access the Share Sheet, you simply navigate to an item you own and tap the &lsquo;Options&rsquo; item on the top right Navigation Bar. Choose the &lsquo;Share&rsquo; option and the iOS share sheet will be presented. </p>

<p>This Share Sheet behaves exactly like all other IOS Share Sheets and allows you to access a variety of ways to share, that vary based on what is installed on your device.</p>

<p>However, one of the most flexible items in the Share Sheet is the &lsquo;Copy&rsquo; item. This item will provide a deep link directly to your item, that can be shared over any medium.</p>

<h3 id="you-are-finished">You Are Finished!</h3>

<p>When your item sells, or you have depleted all available quantity then you can mark the item as sold.

<aside class="notice">
Dibs will monitor the content of your channel to ensure it meets community standards. If it does not, then we will be in contact to help return the store to compliance.
</aside>

<p>You are now ready to finish the setup of your storefront, posting inventory, and inviting customers to your private channel.</p>

<p><strong>Please note</strong> that you will want to also visit the <a href="#creating-your-storefront">Storefront section</a> of this document to <a href="#profile-picture">add your store profile picture</a> and to <a href="#banner-image">add your store image banner background</a>. Once you have your store details, profile image, and banner image complete - you should feel confident to show off your storefront and begin inviting your buyers.</p>

<p>Lastly, you will also receive an email after you finish your registration. This email will contain instructions for you to being using your new channel as well as all the custom links for you to send to your customers, if you should decide to do that on your own and not use the tooling in the app.</p>

<h2 id="advanced-tools-for-wholesale-sellers">Advanced Tools For Wholesale Sellers</h2>

<p>Aside from the advanced storefront seller tools that you get when create a wholesale seller account, there are several other impactful tools that you can use as a wholesale seller. This section describes those tools.</p>

<h2 id="your-private-invite-only-sales-channel">Your Private &amp; Invite Only Sales Channel</h2>

<p>The private sales channel is what is <strong>key</strong> to the Dibs wholesale seller system.  When you post items to your private channel, they remain private and hidden from public view. Items posted to your private channel are only visible to the people you invite to your private channel, and no one else. </p>

<p>When you post new items to your private channel, all the associated new item notifications will be sent to the validated subscribers of your private channel.</p>

<h2 id="customer-invitations-private-channel">Customer Invitations (Private Channel)</h2>

<p>You can invite customers to your private channel via email. By Inviting customers to your private channel, they will be able to receive new item announcements from your store, view wholesale items, and purchase wholesale items. </p>

<p>The invite will have a custom link that will take your customer directly to a personalized (for your private wholesale channel) subscription page. From this page your customers can provide details on their store and submit the request to your for approval. </p>

<p>The requests will be sent via push notification to your app, and will also be emailed to you. When you receive these requests, you will need to review the customers details and then either approve or deny their access. Either action will then notify the user of your decision and either grant or deny access to your private channel.</p>

<p>You can always access their approval requests at a later time and change their enrollment status, should the need arise to do so.</p>

<p>You can invite customers to your private channel by following the  <a href="#sharing-via-friend-invitations">directions provided here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="customers-access-requests">Customers Access Requests</h2>

<p>The customer invitation process offers two points of control, to ensure that only the folks you invite are allowed access to your channel.  These control points include:
- You must send your custom invite link to your customers.
- You must also &lsquo;accept&rsquo; their invitation request once they have completed the registration form.</p>

<p>The invitation approval screen is pictured below. This screen allows your to perform just a few simple actions, including:
- Reviewing the user information from the requesting customer.
- Approving the request, which allows them access to your channel.
- Declining the request, which declines or removes their access from your channel. 
- Closing the request, so that you can review it further later. In this case, no action is taken and the customer is left in the access state they had when you entered this screen.</p>

<p><img src="images/SusanHorneImage.jpg" alt="test.png" /></p>

<p>You can always go back to your Notifications Tab (in the app) later, and manage requests or remove access if your situation changes. </p>

<h2 id="selling-items">Selling Items</h2>

<p>There is a single, yet important, difference when posting items intended to go to your private wholesale channel. The difference is that you will want to explicitly mark the item as a &lsquo;wholesale&rsquo; item. You do this on the second selling screen (pictured below), at the bottom there is a button that allows you to toggle the post between &lsquo;Retail&rsquo; and &lsquo;Wholesale&rsquo;. By choosing the &lsquo;Wholesale&rsquo; option, the item will be posted to your private wholesale channel and become visible to only those customers with access to your channel. The remainder of the selling process is unchanged for selling items to wholesale. </p>

<h2 id="buy-now-and-quantity">Buy Now and Quantity</h2>

<p>When the wholesale channel is selected for your item being posted, you have the option of enabling &lsquo;Buy It Now&rsquo; for that item. This option will allow your customers to complete the purchase of the item, electronically in the app. Upon completion of the transaction, both the seller and buyer will receive follow on notifications so the item shipment, delivery, or pickup can be arranged.</p>

<p>When &lsquo;Buy It Now&rsquo; is enabled, you also need to input an inventory quantity. Please enter whatever quantity you are willing to commit to the Dibs sales channel, as you can hold other inventory for additional sales channels you already use.</p>

<p>If &lsquo;Buy It Now&rsquo; is not enabled, then the default &lsquo;Dibs&rsquo; button will appear for the item. As usual, this button indicates that a Customer would like to purchase the item and when they grab dibs on an items, both the seller and buyer will be ushered into the private chat system to arrange the final details of their transaction.</p>

<aside class="notice">
Buy It Now transactions are subject to the transaction fees listed in our [terms and conditions documents](https://dev-dibs.grabdibs.com/terms-of-use). So take these fees into account when you price and place your item on the Dibs wholesale platform.
</aside>

<p>When the available quantity for an item has been purchased, the item &lsquo;action button&rsquo; will return to the &lsquo;dibs&rsquo; button. This will allow you to continue to garner interest for the item, should you have additional inventory or ordering capacity. However, if you have sold all items and have no ability to fulfill additional orders, then it is best to <a href="#marking-items-sold">mark the item sold</a>. This will still allow customers to see the great types of items available in your store, but it will not allow them to purchase or grab Dibs any longer.</p>

<h2 id="new-item-announcements">New Item Announcements</h2>

<p>Announcements provide a way for you to &ldquo;show&rdquo; your new inventory to your customers and buyers, through one easy interaction.
